# Event System

The event system of S&Box is similar to that of the game Garry's Mod.
You have the possibility to un/register events and declare callbacks.

Through C# you have the possibility to create your [own attributes](##Custom Attributes) that are bound to events. Which strengthen the human readability of your code

## All available Events
[Here you can find a list of all available event attributes](https://asset.party/api/Sandbox.Event)

However, keep in mind the purpose of use, so that you do not call server events on the client.

**This will cause an exception!**

## Setting up a Class
:::info

[Entity](https://asset.party/api/Sandbox.Entity) or [Panel](https://asset.party/api/Sandbox.UI.Panel) based objects are automatically included in the event system.

If your class does not cover the above points - you have to take care of it yourself.

However, this may change in the future to save you additional work.

:::

```cs
public class NonEntityOrPanelClass
{
	/// <summary>
	/// This is the Constructor
	/// We do not derive from Entity or Panel, we need to handle Event Registering ourself
	/// </summary>
	public NonEntityOrPanelClass()
	{
		Event.Register( this );
	}

	/// <summary>
	/// This is the Deconstructor
	/// Since we registered it beforehand, we need do unregister it too.
	/// </summary>
	~NonEntityOrPanelClass()
	{
		Event.Unregister( this );
	}
}
```

## Custom Attributes

If you wish to create a custom Attribute, you can do so in the following

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Declaring a custom Class to host the attributes
/// </summary>
public static class CustomEvent
{
    public const string Custom = "custom";

    public class CustomAttribute : EventAttribute
    {
        public CustomAttribute() : base( Custom ) { }
    }
}

/// <summary>
/// Assign our Attribute to a Function
/// </summary>
[CustomEvent.Custom]
public void OnCustomEvent()
{
    // do something
}

// Call the event, which triggers all the functions that have the attribute assigned
Event.Run( CustomEvent.Custom );
```
